# Keystatic

First-class CMS experience, TypeScript API, Markdown & YAML/JSON based, no DB.

Built with DNA from Keystone, connects directly to GitHub and doesnâ€™t mess with
your source code. Conceived for modern front-end frameworks like Next.js, Remix
and Astro, designed to fit into your workflow.

## Status

We're working on it! Things are experimental at the moment.

There's a package on npm but we're still writing instructions. If you're curious
and brave, reach out to @jedwatson or @simonswiss on Twitter and let us know.
