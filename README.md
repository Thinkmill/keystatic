# Keystatic

First-class CMS experience, TypeScript API, Markdown & YAML/JSON based, no DB.

Built with DNA from Keystone, connects directly to GitHub and doesnâ€™t mess with
your source code. Conceived for modern front-end frameworks like Next.js, Remix
and Astro, designed to fit into your workflow.

## Status

We're working on it! Things are experimental at the moment. And, we don't have
docs yet.

But if you're curious and brave, check out
[keystatic.thinkmill.com.au](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au) to try it out
(and check out our growing collection of templates)

Follow [@thekeystatic](https://twitter.com/thekeystatic) on Twitter, and
[subscribe to our mailing list](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au/#mailing-list)
for updates.

Feedback on how we're going, what you're looking for, and what you'd like to see
next is super helpful as we progress!

## WIP Documentation

We're building the
[first draft of the Keystatic documentation](https://www.notion.so/thinkmill/Keystatic-9f141cb1ac3c44b5ad02f1ae9b5543d8)
in a public Notion space.

Things will evolve and likely change, but this give you a "real-time" visibility
on what's available in terms of docs!
