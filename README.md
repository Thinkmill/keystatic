# Keystatic

First-class CMS experience, TypeScript API, Markdown & YAML/JSON based, no DB.

Built with DNA from Keystone, connects directly to GitHub and doesnâ€™t mess with
your source code. Conceived for modern front-end frameworks like Next.js, Remix
and Astro, designed to fit into your workflow.
