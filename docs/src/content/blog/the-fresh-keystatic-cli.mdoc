The freshly baked Keystatic CLI is now published on npm ðŸ”¥

You can run `npm create @keystatic@latest` in your terminal to try it out!

Check out the video below, where Simon demoes the CLI, spins up the project and adds new a "Draft" checkbox field to the Keystatic config file:

{% embed
   mediaType="video"
   embedCode="<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3pywDv-0Tg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>" /%}

The CLI creates a basic Next.js app (using the new App Router), and comes with a simple Keystatic integration showing how to use the [Collections API](/docs/collections-and-singletons#collections).

We're also planning to add more frameworks in the near future, so stay tuned!
