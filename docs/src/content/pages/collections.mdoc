Think of a `collection` as anything you’d want multiple instances of. A series of blog posts, cooking recipes, or testimonials from happy customers.

Collections are defined within the `collections` key of the Keystatic `config`. Each collection has its own key and is wrapped in a `collection()` function.

## Example

Here’s how you’d define a `testimonial` collection, where each entry has an `author` and a `quote` fields:

```jsx
// keystatic.config.ts
import { config, collection } from '@keystatic/core';

export default config({
  // ...
  collections: {
    testimonials: collection({
      label: 'Testimonials',
      slugField: 'author',
      schema: {
        author: fields.slug({ name: { label: 'Author' } }),
        quote: fields.text({ label: 'Quote', multiline: true })
      }
    }),
  },
});
```

## Options

### Columns

By default, only the “slug” of each entry is displayed in the collection table. You can show additional fields by passing a `columns` option.

{% aside icon="⏱️" %}
Fetching data for each entry takes time. Large collections may benefit from displaying the slug only.
{% /aside %}

#### Basic columns

Pass an array of field keys to show them in the collection table:

```ts
columns: ['title', 'publishedOn'] 
```

#### Columns definition

For more control, use a `columns` object with a `definition` array. Column definitions require a `defaultSort` option.

```ts
columns: {
  definition: [
    { key: 'title', isRowHeader: true },
    {
      key: 'publishedOn',
      label: 'Published',
      width: 140,
      align: 'end'
    },
  ],
  defaultSort: {
    column: 'publishedOn',
    direction: 'descending'
  }
}
```

{% table %}
- Property

---
- `align`

---
- `key` (required)
- The key of the column.
---
- `label`
- The label of the column. Defaults to the label of the matching schema field, by `key`.

{% /table %}

### Label

`label` — defines the name of the collection. This is used in the Admin UI to label the collection.

### Entry layout

`entryLayout` — change the layout of the Admin UI for a collection entry.

Learn more on the [Entry Layout](/docs/entry-layout) page.

### Format

`format` — provides options around the data format of your collection entries.

Learn more on the [Format Options](/docs/format-options) page.

### Path

`path` — allows you to you specify *where* to store entries for any given collection:

```tsx
path: 'custom/content/path/testimonials/*'
```

By default, Keystatic will store entries at the root of your project, in a directory that matches the collection key.

You can learn more about the `path` option on the [Content organisation page](/docs/content-organisation).

### Parse slug for sort

`parseSlugForSort` — a function to transform the `slug` of each entry into a value to be used for sorting the collection list view.

### Preview URL

`previewURL` — used to configure [Real-time Previews](/docs/recipes/real-time-previews) of your content.

### Schema

`schema` — defines the fields that each entry in the collection should have.

### Slug field

`slugField` — defines what field in your collection `schema` should be used as the slug for each item.

It’s recommended to combine it with the [slug field](/docs/fields/slug) to let users customise and regenerate each slug in the Admin UI.

```typescript
testimonials: collection({
  label: 'Testimonials',
  schema: {
    title: fields.slug({ name: { label: 'Title' } }),
  },
  slugField: 'title',
}),
```

### Template

`template` — the path to a content file (existing collection entry or “template”) to use as a starting point for new entries.
