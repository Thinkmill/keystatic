[Keystatic Cloud](https://keystatic.cloud) is a service provided by [Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au).

Cloud simplifies authentication (GitHub) with your projects. No need to deal with environment variables and a custom GitHub app.

Keystatic Cloud also offers opt-in products such as **Cloud Images** â€” an image storage, optimisation and delivery service.

## Authentication

Keystatic Cloud lets you connect to GitHub and authenticate for one or multiple Keystatic projects.

It skips the more complicated process of [setting up GitHub mode](/docs/github-mode), while also allowing team members to edit content without needing a GitHub account.

You'll need to [create a Keystatic Cloud account](https://keystatic.cloud) to start using this service.

You can setup multiple projects in your Keystatic Cloud account â€”Â where each project is connected to a specific GitHub repository.

### Configuring your project

In your Keystatic config, you'll need to set the `storage` option to `cloud`. 

You'll also need to add the `cloud.project` property with the name of the team and project from your Keystatic Cloud account:

```ts 
import { config } from '@keystatic/core'

export default config({
  storage: {
    kind: 'cloud',
  },
  cloud: {
    project: '[TEAM_NAME]/[PROJECT_NAME]',
  },
  ...
})
```

Each project in Keystatic Cloud has a settings page where you'll find a ready-to-paste code snippet in your config file.

## Cloud Images

Cloud Images is an opt-in service from Keystatic Cloud. It's an image storage and delivery service that optimises your images for the web.

Each Keystatic Cloud project can have its own Image Library, where you can upload images and copy the URL to use in your content.

### Image optimisation via URL query parameters

When using Keystatic Cloude image URLs, you can pass the following optional query parameters to drastically improve the performance of your images:

- **`fit`** â€”Â how the image should be resized to fit the dimensions you specify. Possible values are `scale-down`, `contain`, `cover` and `crop`.
- **`format (f)`** â€”Â the image format to use. Possible values are `png`, `avif`, `webp` and `jpeg`. 
  If no format is provided, Keystatic Cloud will auto-detect browser capabilities and serve the most optimal format.
- **`quality (q)`** â€”Â the quality of the image. A number between `1` and `100`.
- **`height (h)`** â€”Â the height of the image. A number between `1` and `10240`.
- **`width (w)`** â€”Â the width of the image. A number between `1` and `10240`.

You can provide one or both of height and width, which will have a different effect based on the fit.

Here's an example URL with image transform query parameters: 

```
https://[IMAGE_URL]?width=240&height=480&fit=crop
```

### Cloud image field

Keystatic provides a [`cloudImage` field](/docs/fields/cloud-image), which can be used instead of the [regular image field](/docs/fields/image) if Keystatic is running in cloud mode, and the Image Library is enabled for the project.

### Cloud image component block (experimental)

Keystatic also provides a `CloudImage` component block, which can be used within the flow of a [document field](/docs/fields/document).

Again, you'll need Keystatic running in `cloud` mode, and have the Image Library enabled for the project.

Documentation for the `CloudImage` component block is coming soon.
