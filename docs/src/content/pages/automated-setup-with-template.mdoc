**TL:DR**

Keystatic deeply integrates with GitHub.

To use it, you need:

- A **GitHub repository** for your project
- A **custom GitHub App** that is allowed to access your project repo

You _can_ do that manually‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôve created a little semi-automated onboarding process. It turns a lengthy manual setup into a series of‚Ä¶ _button clicks_ ‚ú®
{% /component-block-prop %}
{% /aside %}

You‚Äôll be promoted to go through a few steps. You can read the **step by step walkthrough** below for details, but here‚Äôs a visual representation of the _mostly automated_ journey you‚Äôll be taken on:

**Disclaimer/context**

To automate the creation of the GitHub repo and set it up with the GitHub App, we‚Äôre leveraging Vercel as a platform. It helps us create, deploy a repo and hook into the project creation to create the GitHub App and add required environment variables.

This lets us provide the _quickest pathway_ to having a Keystatic project setup and deployed to start iterating. That said, **using Vercel is not a requirement** - you can host a Keystatic project somewhere else. Vercel just happens to help us ‚Äúautomate‚Äù the getting started story elegantly.

We‚Äôll be adding more pathways to create a new project as we go, and based on the feedback we get.

## Step by step walkthrough

Start by visiting the following URL: [https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au)

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d54f006d-9260-40b8-9fd4-4bfd58af7f48/Untitled.png

Select one of the starter templates:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6e079d6e-1d0e-4864-a2fa-9c0071d6a459/Untitled.png

You‚Äôll be prompted to tell us about yourself. This is optional, but it helps us understand _who_ is using Keystatic and how we can make it better.

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2144ec45-e6b0-4ee6-a862-ed625ace2d25/Untitled.png

After that, you‚Äôll be taken to Vercel‚Äôs project starter dashboard, where you‚Äôll be prompted to create a new GIT repo based on the template you‚Äôve selected in the previous step:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6ce9de9c-a7e2-4c64-b15a-004ae5ff5687/Untitled.png

Change the GitHub scope and repo name if needed, and click the create button.

You will then be prompted to add an integration:

Click Add. You may need to authenticate with GitHub if you have 2FA turned on:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/dbc21bff-e291-4f16-a337-83973075585f/Untitled.png

You‚Äôll be prompted to create a new GitHub App:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d11eae82-e8e3-4696-ac5a-298911955621/Untitled.png

When you do so, you‚Äôll be redirected back to the Vercel project starter, and you‚Äôll see your new project being deployed üéâ

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/fb84550d-acd1-4321-b20f-91bbd354743b/Untitled.png

Once the project is deployed, you will be prompted to install the GitHub App you‚Äôve created.

Click Install & Authorize.

Aaaaannnnd‚Ä¶ Here comes Keystatic! ‚ú®

At this point, you‚Äôre all setup with a fully deployed project using Keystatic. You can start creating, editing and deleting content.

## Remote setup

Chances are you want to work on your project locally though. Let‚Äôs get you setup on your machine.

First, clone the GitHub repo you‚Äôve just created:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a8d67dca-8db6-4171-8b04-a2ee568f1c09/Untitled.png

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/71fd5d0b-383c-4c46-b76d-4a7278e789aa/Untitled.png

Move into your cloned repo, and run `npm install` to add the dependencies:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/df729c8f-db2d-467c-a885-180fe9284935/Untitled.png

If you try running the project with `npm run dev` and visit the `/keystatic` URL, you‚Äôll find out you‚Äôre missing some required environment variables:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/08a1fb8f-5a68-48ae-a63a-5f2d164f5de1/Untitled.png

Why did that not happen on the remote?

Well, behind the scenes, those variables were created and added to the Vercel project.

Check this out:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cf955dd1-d279-429b-bb51-d39a22d3e86e/Untitled.png

If you open up your local project with your code editor of choice and check the `.env` file, you‚Äôll see‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs empty:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/03370945-814c-4d64-ac0d-b7f362203fda/Untitled.png

Copy the environment variables from the `Development` environment from Vercel:

<aside> üíª **Note:** If you‚Äôre using the `vercel` CLI, you can also pull these environment variables into your project:

1. `vercel link` to link the project
1. `vercel env pull` to pull the variables

You‚Äôll end up with a series of variables starting with `VERCEL_*`, that you can safely delete.

When you‚Äôre done, your `.env` file should look like this:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4625fffa-fc64-4275-a5c3-855c10031942/Untitled.png

**Congratulations! ‚ú®**

At this point, you‚Äôre all setup locally and remotely. You just need to make sure that your project runs on port `3000`.

Have a play with Keystatic and let us know what you think!

**Where‚Äôs the front end?**

If you‚Äôve selected the `blank` starter template, you won‚Äôt have any frontend besides the ‚ÄúGo to Keystatic‚Äù link.

For examples of front ends wired up with Keystatic with some demo content, try out one of our existing [templates](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au) like the [Marketing Landing Page](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au?template=marketing) or the [Blog Template](https://keystatic.thinkmill.com.au?template=blog)!

## Take-home challenge

Here‚Äôs a mini challenge to get you started.

The `keystatic.tsx` file is where we define Keystatic‚Äôs content schema. You can see that right now, we have a `collection` of `posts` setup:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a18d4c54-09dc-4f3a-97b2-4510322bb114/Untitled.png

It‚Äôs set to generate content in `content/posts`, and if you look at the `schema` object, you‚Äôll see fields defined for a `title`, `slug`, `content`and `authors`:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7575b7ba-c87f-419d-af7f-5e376308d95d/Untitled.png

Surprise surprise, if you go in the Keystatic Admin UI and create a new post, those are the exact fields you can see:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/59f548a6-cf6b-42e2-9c7c-374b18c6decc/Untitled.png

Just for fun, add a new field to the posts‚Äô `schema`. Anything you‚Äôd like to try!

Actually, the TypeScript autocompletion makes is super easy to see what‚Äôs available.

Choose a new field name, type `fields.` and you should be presented with some choices:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/11e00bc9-eab9-4c5a-9de1-79023766d368/Untitled.png

Here I‚Äôll choose `checkbox`, but feel free to try something else! I‚Äôll add a required `label` too:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/66bfb345-436c-4213-8e43-f2541fc11fc6/Untitled.png

When you‚Äôre done, hit save and head back to the browser and look at what happened:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/49801581-521f-483b-9343-1b0747ee1458/Untitled.png

Oh, look! A new opt-in checkbox üéâ

Notice on the top left that you‚Äôre on the `main` branch. When you create the post, it will merge it directly to your main branch!

Instead, create a new branch from the menu next to the branch dropdown:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6df992c6-5d6c-4a43-8b50-2d4fc6eb3c30/Untitled.png

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b24c138c-c0a1-423a-ae63-f76ec113cd82/Untitled.png

You are now on the `test` branch, and you can even see a new option to create a Pull Request!

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/16906ded-6fe6-4df3-aba5-99e5a71986c6/Untitled.png

Okay, fill up the new post form with some content, and hit create:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/97b4c309-550b-4423-885c-8a9d58682896/Untitled.png

You‚Äôve just created a commit in the `test` branch on the GitHub remote!

Go check! But actually, it‚Äôs even more rewarding to create a PR from the Admin UI:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c989295c-5ff3-4f0f-87fe-0a46ff81cfc9/Untitled.png

Yep - you can see a new PR form on GitHub.

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7a9a9454-f4cc-4145-a419-8a036c3e473f/Untitled.png

Scroll down, and see the changes made to the codebase:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d9f67856-18d4-463e-91b4-7b20db51719f/Untitled.png

The new post is being created in `content/posts`, just like we defined in the `config.ts`.

You can‚Äôt see these code changes locally, they‚Äôre only on the remote so far.

You can pull the `test` branch, or create and merge that new PR and pull from `main`:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/009a1a0a-14fb-4e7d-a88e-ac3f93fd78c0/Untitled.png

After pulling, you‚Äôll see the new `content/posts` folder in your local project:

Missing image https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f942a66e-7b73-4873-a0d0-f8d8e661d922/Untitled.png

Nicely done!

We hope this onboarding guide was useful ‚ù§Ô∏è
