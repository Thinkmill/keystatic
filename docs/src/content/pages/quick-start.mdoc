title: Quick start
---
The quickest way to get started in Keystatic is to `git clone` one of our templates from Github.

- [Blank template](https://github.com/Thinkmill/keystatic-template) - a barebones starting point. Keystatic with a simple Post collection, and no frontend design.
- [Landing page template](https://github.com/Thinkmill/keystatic-starter-landing-page) - a fictive product marketing landing page demo, built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js.
- [Blog template](https://github.com/Thinkmill/keystatic-starter-blog) - a blog post starter template showcasing Keystatic's Document field. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Once you have cloned the repo locally, getting it up and running is as simple as:

1. `npm install` in your project directory.
1. `npm run dev`
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to check out the homepage.
1. Head to [http://localhost:3000/keystatic](http://localhost:3000/keystatic) in your browser to check out the Keystatic Admin UI.
