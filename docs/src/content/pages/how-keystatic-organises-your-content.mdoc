title: How Keystatic organises your content
summary: Control and flexibility with where your content gets generated.
---
Keystatic has two&nbsp;*concepts*&nbsp;or structures to organise data:&nbsp;`collections`&nbsp;and&nbsp;`singletons`.

Those are defined in the&nbsp;[Keystatic configuration](/docs/configuration).

You get a lot of control and flexibility with *where* your content gets generated, both at the `collection` or `singleton` level, and at the `field` level for certain field types, like images.

## Content path

You can define *where* Keystatic should store collection entries and singletons via the `path` property in the collection/singleton top-level options.

```javascript
// Keystatic config
export default config({
  collections: {
    posts: collection({
      label: 'Posts',
      path: 'content/posts/*/',
      // ...
    })
  },
  singletons: {
    settings: singleton({
      label: 'Settings',
      path: 'content/posts/',
      // ...
   })
  }
})

```

The optional trailing slash `/` on that path has an impact on the content structure - read below for more details on `collection paths` and `singleton paths`.

### Path wildcard for collections

The `path` property for `collections` must contain a `*` wildcard. 

It represents the `slug` of an entry.

This wildcard gives you flexibility and control over your where your content is being output.

### Nested folder output example

{% aside icon="👉" %}
  `path: 'packages/design-system/*/docs/'`
{% /aside %}

Imagine a Design System inside a monorepo: 

```sh
root
├── packages
  ├── design-system
    ├── button
      └── src
    ├── dropdown
      └── src
└── apps
  └── docs(keystatic)
```

Your Keystatic site lives in `apps/docs`, but you want your documentation entries in `packages/design-system/{component-name}/docs/`, to collocate them with each component.

The following path will let you do exactly that:

```
path: 'packages/design-system/*/docs/'
```

### Nested slug example

{% aside icon="👉" %}
  `path: 'content/posts/**/*'`
{% /aside %}

There may be situations where you need the `slug` of an entry to be following a multi-folder structure.

Say you want the **same collection** to support this following tree structure:

```sh
content
├── posts
  ├── en  
      └── post-1.mdoc
  ├── fr  
      └── post-1.mdoc
```

You can enable this by using the `**/*` wildcard in your `path`: 

```
path: 'content/posts/**/*'
```

Since Keystatic `slugs` can contain `/` characters, you construct a multi-folder structure with `slug` field values like: `en/post-1` and `fr/post-1`.

---

## Collections

The default `path` value, if not specified, will be `{collection-name}/*/`.

### Collection paths ending with a trailing slash `/`

If the path ends with a trailing slash `/`, each entry will be created in its own directory named after the slug:

```yaml
collection-name
└── slug
    ├── index.yaml
    └── other.mdoc
```

Say you create two entries in the `posts` collection, where the `path` is set to `'content/posts/*/'`.

Since there is a trailing slash in the `path`, the generated output will look like so:

```yaml
content
└── posts
    ├── my-first-post
        ├── index.yaml
        ├── other.mdoc
    └── my-second-post
        ├── index.yaml
        └── other.mdoc
```

### Collection paths ending without a trailing slash

If the path does not end with a trailing slash, entries' index files will be created immediately inside the collection directory:

```yaml
collection-name
├── slug.yaml
└── slug
    └── other.mdoc
```

Say you create two entries in the `posts` collection, where the `path` is set to `'content/posts/*'`.

Since there is no trailing slash in the `path`, the generated output will look like so:

```yaml
content
└── posts
    ├── my-first-post.yaml
    └── my-first-post
        └── other.mdoc
    ├── my-second-post.yaml
    └── my-second-post
        └── other.mdoc
```

---

## Singletons

The `path` property for singletons does not contain a `*` wildcard.

If not specified, the default `path` value for singletons will be `{singleton-name}/`.

### Singleton paths ending with a trailing slash `/`

If the path ends with a trailing slash `/`, the singleton's content ill be created in its own directory named after the slug:

```yaml
singleton-name
└── slug
    ├── index.yaml
    └── other.mdoc

```

### Singleton paths ending without a trailing slash

If the path does not end with a trailing slash, the singleton's index file will be created immediately inside the singleton directory:

```yaml
singleton-name
├── slug.yaml
└── slug
    └── other.mdoc

```

---

## Individual fields output

Right now, only **images** allow you to decide *where* content should be generated, independently of the `collection/singleton` level `path` settings.

{% aside icon="⚡️" %}
The reason for this is certain frameworks (like Next.js) need your images to be in a specific directory (like `/public`) to be easily accessible.

Instead of generating **all** your content inside the `public` directory to satisfy this requirement, Keystatic lets you define a specific path for your images only.
{% /aside %}

Here's how you define where an image gets generated for a given `collection` or `singleton`:

```javascript
// In the context of a `posts` collection...
coverImage: fields.image({
  label: "Cover Image",
  directory: "public/images/posts",
}),

```

Regardless of where the `posts` entries are created, the `coverImage` image will be generated in `public/images/posts/{post-slug}`.
