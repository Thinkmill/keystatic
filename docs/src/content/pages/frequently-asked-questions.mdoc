## Do I need "reactStrictMode: false" to use Keystatic?

Yes, you do.

If you're hitting strange issues, like your content not persisting after hitting save, or some Admin UI error notificationsâ€¦ there's a good chance you have React Strict Mode turned on.

Turning it off will make most of those issues go away.

## When uploading an image I received the error "Body exceeded 1mb limit"

When creating or editing an entry in the Admin UI, you might hit the following error when trying to save your changes:

{% cloud-image
   href="https://keystatic.io/images/keystatic-docs/faq1.png"
   alt="Screenshot of the Keystatic Admin with the error message \"Body exceeded 1mb limit\"" /%}

In the context of Next.js, this is because API routes have size limitations for requests and responses.

You can increase (or turn off in the case of the response) these limits by **exporting a custom config** to the `pages/api/keystatic/[[...params]].tsx` API page like so:

```diff
import { makeAPIRouteHandler } from '@keystatic/next/api'
import keystaticConfig from '../../../keystatic.config'

+ export const config = {
+   api: {
+     bodyParser: {
+       sizeLimit: '20mb',
+     },
+     responseLimit: '20mb',
+   },
+ }

export default makeAPIRouteHandler({ config: keystaticConfig })

```
