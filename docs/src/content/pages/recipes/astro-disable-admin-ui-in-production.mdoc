When using the `local` strategy, you may want to disable access to the `/keystatic` routes in production.

Here's how you can prevent access to (and indexing of) those routes when using the Astro framework.

## Conditionally render the Astro plugin

If you've followed the [Astro integration guide](/docs/installation-astro), you should have a `keystatic` integration in your `astro.config.mjs` file. Now, we'll introduce a condition in the configuration file which will enable us to use an environment variable to determine when Keystatic should be mounted.

```diff
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

import react from '@astrojs/react'
import markdoc from '@astrojs/markdoc'
import keystatic from '@keystatic/astro'

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
-  integrations: [react(), markdoc(), keystatic()],
+  integrations: [react(), markdoc(), ...(process.env.SKIP_KEYSTATIC ? [] : [keystatic()])],
})

```

The condition above will not mount Keystatic if `SKIP_KEYSTATIC=true` is present in your environment variables. If `SKIP_KEYSTATIC` is not defined or set to false, Keystatic will be mounted.

## Adding environment variables

We won't cover every host here but you can check out [Astro's deploy guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for a more exhaustive list.

### Vercel

If you're deploying your Astro project with Vercel, you can add environment variables in your project's settings.

- Navigate to Project -> Settings -> Environment variables. 
- In the 'Key' field, type `SKIP_KEYSTATIC` and in the 'Value' field, type `true`.
- Click 'Save'

Check out [Vercel's official docs](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for further details.

### Netlify
If you're deploying your Astro project with Netlify, you can add environment variables in your site's configuration page. 

- Navigate to Site -> Site configuration -> Environment variables. 
- Add a new variable by clicking 'Add a variable' and 'Add a single variable'. 
- Set the 'Key' as `SKIP_KEYSTATIC` and the 'Value' as `true`.
- Click 'Save variable'

Refer to [Netlify's official docs](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#site-environment-variables) for additional guidance.

## Re-deploy
Re-deploy your project for your changes to take effect. Keystatic routes will no longer deploy to production (routes won't be indexed or added to sitemaps) and you can still run Keystatic on your local machine.
