title: MDX field
summary: WYSIWYG editor for MDX
---

The `mdx` field reads and writes content in MDX.

## Example usage

```tsx
// Keystatic config
import { fields } from '@keystatic/core'

// Inside a collection...
schema: {
 richText: fields.mdx({
  label: 'Rich text'
 })
}
```

Keystatic will store content and retrieve it for you using the [Reader API](/docs/reader-api), but you are responsible for rendering the MDX content. 

You can use community tools or build your own.

## Content components

The `mdx` field uses the new-generation and more capable [content components](/docs/content-components):

```diff
richText: fields.mdx({
 label: 'Rich text',
+ components: {
+  // Add custom components here
+ } 
})
```
Checkout the [content components](/docs/content-components) docs to learn how to create advanced editing experiences with the `mdx` field.

## MDX limitations in Keystatic

### No import statements

Keystatic statically analyzses the MDX content. This means you cannot have `import` statements inside the MDX file.

This won't work:

```mdx
---
title: My first post
date: 2024-02-17
---

import { Card } from '../components/Card'

# Hello, world!

<Card title="This week's update" />
```

Remove the import from the MDX file. Instead, pass the components you want to import to the component responsible for rendering the MDX content:

```tsx
import { Card } from '../components/Card'

<MdxRenderer components={{ Card }} />
```

### No HTML tags

HTML tags in MDX are not supported by Keystatic. Replace them with their Markdown equivalent. 

For example...

```diff
- Learn more on the <a href="https://keystatic.com">Keystatic website</a>.
+ Learn more on the [Keystatic website](https://keystatic.com).
```

...or 

```diff
- <blockquote>Wow, this is pretty cool!</blockquote>
+ > Wow, this is pretty cool!
```
