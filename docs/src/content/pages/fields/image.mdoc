title: Image field
---
The `image` field is used to upload an image.

You can specify an optional `directory` where to store that image in your project tree. This is useful when you want your images in a `public` or `static` directory, to adhere to conventions for a specific framework.

There's also an optional `publicPath` option that lets you define how the image path should be retrieved when reading the value of the field.

## Example usage

```typescript
avatar: fields.image({
  label: 'Avatar',
  description: 'The avatar for this user',
  // This will output the images in the "public" directory
  directory: 'public/images/avatars',
  publicPath: '/images/avatars/'
})
```

## Type signature

```typescript
image({
  label: string;
  directory?: string;
  validation?: {
    isRequired?: IsRequired;
  };
  description?: string;
  publicPath?: string;
})
```
