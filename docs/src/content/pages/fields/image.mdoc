{% fieldDemo field="image" /%}

The `image` field is used to store an image. In the Admin UI it renders an image picker component.

In [local storage mode](/docs/local-vs-git-hub-storage-strategy#local-strategy) it will save it as a file in your repository. In [GitHub storage mode](/docs/local-vs-git-hub-storage-strategy#git-hub-strategy) it will commit it into the repository.

## Storage options

You can optionally specify a `directory` from your project tree to store the image in. This is useful when you want your images in a `public` or `static` directory, to adhere to conventions for a specific framework.

There's also an optional `publicPath` that lets you define how the image path should be retrieved when reading the value of the field.

## Example usage

```typescript
avatar: fields.image({
  label: 'Avatar',
  description: 'The avatar for this user',
  // This will output the images in the "public" directory
  directory: 'public/images/avatars',
  publicPath: '/images/avatars/'
})
```
