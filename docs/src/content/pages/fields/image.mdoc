title: Image field
summary: The image field is used to store an image.
---

The `image` field is used to store an image. In the Admin UI it renders an image picker component:

{% field-demo field="image" /%}

Images will be stored on your local file system or GitHub repository. 

For a cloud-based alternative, see the [Cloud image field](/docs/fields/cloud-image) designed for [Keystatic Cloud](/docs/cloud).

## Image storage options

The default behaviour of the image field is to create a directory matching the entry `slug`, and place an image named after the `image` field inside.

Take the following configuration:

```typescript
authors: collection({
  schema: {
    // ...
    avatar: fields.image({ label: 'Avatar' })
  }
})
```

Creating a `john-doe` author and uploading a `jpg` image for the `avatar` will generate the following:

```sh
authors
├── john-doe
    └── avatar.jpg
└── john-doe.yaml
```

The value stored in the `john-doe.yaml` file for the `avatar` will be:

```yaml
avatar: avatar.jpg
```

This is workable, but quite often you'll want to configure: 

- _where_ the image is stored
- _how_ the reference path to the image is constructed

### Directory

You can specify a `directory` from your project tree.

Say you want to output images in the `public` directory:

```diff
avatar: fields.image({
  label: 'Avatar',
+ directory: 'public/images/avatars',
})
```

Uploading a `jpg` image on the `john-doe` entry would now output the following:

```sh
authors
└── john-doe.yaml
public
└── images
    └── avatars
        └── john-doe
            └── avatar.jpg
```

{% aside icon="☝️" %}
The value stored in the `john-doe` file will still be: 

`avatar: avatar.jpg` 

...so chances are you'll also want to configure the `publicPath` option.

{% /aside %}

### Public path

The `publicPath` option lets you control how the path to the image (as you'd use in the front end) is constructed:

```diff
avatar: fields.image({
  label: 'Avatar',
  directory: 'public/images/avatars',
+ publicPath: '/images/avatars/'
})
```

The entry slug and image field name will be composed with this `publicPath`. 

Here's how the `avatar` field would now be stored with our `john-doe` example:

```yaml
avatar: /images/avatars/john-doe/avatar.jpg
```
