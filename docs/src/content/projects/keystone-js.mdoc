Keystone helps you build faster and scale further than any other CMS or App Framework. Just describe your schema, and get a powerful GraphQL API & beautiful Management UI for content and data.

No boilerplate or bootstrapping â€“ just elegant APIs to help you ship the code that matters without sacrificing the flexibility or power of a bespoke back-end.
