The Marketing Landing Page demo was one of the first projects powered by Keystatic.

Before the [Keystatic CLI](https://keystatic.com/docs/quick-start) was a thing (and became the recommended way to start new Keystatic projects), this was one of the "starter templates" for newcomers to Keystatic.

## Singletons and Collections

This templates demonstrates the use of both Keystatic content types: `singletons` and `collections`:

## Keystatic config

Here's what the config file looks like:

```typescript
import {
  collection,
  config,
  fields,
  singleton,
} from "@keystatic/core";

export default config({
  storage: { kind: "local" },
  singletons: {
    landingPage: singleton({
      label: "Landing Page",
      path: "content/landing-page/",
      schema: {
        heroHeadline: fields.text({ label: "Hero headline" }),
        heroIntroText: fields.text({
          label: "Hero intro text",
          multiline: true,
        }),
        footerHeadline: fields.text({ label: "Footer headline" }),
        footerText: fields.text({ label: "Footer text", multiline: true }),
      },
    }),
  },
  collections: {
    testimonials: collection({
      path: "content/testimonials/*/",
      label: "Testimonials",
      slugField: "author",
      schema: {
        author: fields.slug({ name: { label: "Author" } }),
        testimonial: fields.text({ label: "Testimonial", multiline: true }),
        featured: fields.checkbox({ label: "Featured testimonial" }),
        twitterHandle: fields.text({ label: "Twitter handle" }),
        avatar: fields.image({
          label: "Avatar",
          directory: "public/images/testimonials",
          validation: { isRequired: true },
        }),
      },
    }),
  },
});

```
