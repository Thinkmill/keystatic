Better Dev Screencasts was possibly the **very first Keystatic website in production**. In early 2023, Simon from the Thinkmill Labs team used this site to "dogfood" Keystatic as it was being developed.

To this date, Keystatic powers the site's `posts` content types, which support custom components for YouTube videos and Tweet embeds.

## Keystatic config

Here's what the config for the `posts` collection looks like in this project:

```typescript
posts: collection({
  label: 'Posts',
  path: 'content/posts/*',
  slugField: 'title',
  format: {
    contentField: 'content',
  },
  entryLayout: 'content',
  schema: {
    title: fields.slug({ name: { label: 'Title' } }),
    date: fields.date({ 
      label: 'Date', 
      validation: { isRequired: true } 
    }),
    excerpt: fields.text({ label: 'Excerpt' }),
    coverImage: fields.image({
      label: 'Cover image',
      directory: 'public/images/posts',
      publicPath: '/images/posts',
    }),
    content: fields.document({
      label: 'Post copy',
      layouts: [[1, 1]],
      formatting: true,
      dividers: true,
      links: true,
      componentBlocks,
    }),
  },
}),
```

{% aside icon="☝️" %}
The API for the `componentBlocks` is slightly outdated and likely to change in the future, so we won't share the code snippet here —&nbsp;but you can find it on the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/simonswiss/better-dev/blob/main/component-blocks.tsx) which is public!
