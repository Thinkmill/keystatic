        Keystatic Privacy Policy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Keystatic is software developed and maintained by Thinkmill Labs Pty Ltd
        (“<strong>Thinkmill</strong>”). This privacy policy describes how we
        collect, manage and hold <strong>your personal data</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Included in this policy is rationale for why we are collecting this
        information, how it is collected, and why you need, or may want, to{' '}
        <strong>opt-in</strong>. By opting-in, <strong>you consent </strong>
        to us collecting, holding, analysing and using the data which you
        provide in accordance with this policy, which may be updated from time
        to time. This policy also outlines how we manage and provide you access
        to this information.
      </p>
      <h2>What is personal information?</h2>
      <p>
        By "personal information" or “personal data” we mean information or an
        opinion about an identified individual or about an individual who is
        reasonably identifiable from the information. We will not collect
        sensitive information from you unless you voluntarily provide it. By
        voluntarily providing your sensitive information, you consent to our
        collection and use of this information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>
      <h2>Collection of information</h2>
      <p>
        We ask for your <strong>personal information </strong>in our mailer
        sign-up form. This sign-up form is located on the Keystatic website. You
        will be shown the sign-up form, but are able to{' '}
        <strong>skip this step</strong> based on your preference to receive{' '}
        <strong>or not receive </strong>
        communications from Thinkmill Labs Pty Ltd about Keystatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only collect personal information (1) that will{' '}
        <strong>reasonably inform our ability to improve Keystatic </strong>
        software for its users; and (2) so that we may communicate with you; and
        we do so in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles. The types
        of personal information we collect and hold are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Names;</li>
        <li>Email addresses;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An open-text field where you voluntarily submit information of your
        choosing which could include, the type of project you're working on,
        what you'd like to do with Keystatic etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your opt-in consent to join our mailing list for launch communications
        and information related to Keystatic and its development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Details of your visits to our site (including traffic and location
        information, which pages you visit, weblogs and other communication
        information, the previous page visited and the type of browser you are
        using). We do not keep all of the above information. In many cases, we
        may have only one or two pieces of data relating to any particular
        person. What information we collect depends on what type of interaction
        you have with us.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do we collect and hold personal information?</h2>
      <p>
        This sign-up form has been created as part of the early-access launch of
        Keystatic to the technology community. We are collecting this personal
        information/data so that we may communicate with you, to help us
        understand how Keystatic may be used, and to learn about the people
        trying this new software. Completing the sign-up form, and providing
        your personal information, is{' '}
        <strong>not required to use the Keystatic software</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect and hold personal information for{' '}
        <strong>a variety of purposes </strong>– and different kinds of personal
        information are used for different purposes. In each case, however, the
        personal information we collect and hold is reasonably necessary for our
        ability to better improve Keystatic, understand how and why you may use
        it, including to provide you with the type of software you would expect
        from us, and to provide you with relevant updates on our product
        development journey. These purposes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To provide you with news and information which we believe may interest
          you;
        </li>
        <li>
          To help us maintain, develop and enhance Keystatic and the
          communications relating to its use;
        </li>
        <li>For analysis and research;</li>
        <li>To communicate with you (including by email);</li>
        <li>For system administration;</li>
        <li>
          To investigate any complaints about, or made by, you, or if we have
          reason to suspect that you are in breach of any of our terms and
          conditions or applicable codes of conduct or that you are, have been
          or may be engaged in any unlawful activity; and
        </li>
        <li>
          As required or permitted by any law (including privacy legislation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may and do use various cloud computing and online services and may
        and do outsource some (mostly logistical and administrative) tasks
        and/or services to third party providers (such as AirTable). Such cloud
        and online services and third party providers may be located in
        Australia or overseas and use of such services and/or providers may
        result in disclosure of personal information/data to such third party
        services and/or providers. By accepting this privacy policy, you
        authorise and consent to any such disclosure of personal
        information/data.

      <h2>Steps we take to secure personal information</h2>
      <p>
        We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is

      <p>
        Please note, however, that the transmission of information (including

        best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the
        security of your information – particularly while it is being
        transmitted to us – so any transmission is at your own risk and we

        access to, your personal information where the security of information
        is not within our control.

        If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your
        personal information, please let us know immediately.

        We review our Privacy Policy from time to time, to ensure it is in line
        with best practice and up-to-date with any legislative changes. Any

        and made available online. Our use of your personal information will be
        governed by our most recent policy. Please contact our Privacy Officer
