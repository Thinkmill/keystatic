# @voussoir/field

The `Field` component associates a form control with a label, and an optional
description and/or error message. This is useful for providing context about how
users should fill in a field, or a validation message. `Field` takes care of
creating IDs for each element and associating them with the correct ARIA
attributes (`aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`).
