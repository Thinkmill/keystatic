description:
  A utility component for displaying emoji characters accessibly. Emojis can add
  playfulness to your interface, but require formatting to ensure that they are
  accessible for all users.
category: Typography

## Example

```jsx {% live=true %}
<Emoji symbol="ðŸ‘‹" label="Hi there!" />
```

## Patterns

### Semantic

The label provided will be announced by screen readers as part of any
surrounding text.

```jsx {% live=true %}
<Text>
  Built with <Emoji symbol="ðŸ’–" label="love" /> using Keystar UI.
</Text>
```

### Decorative

When no label is provided the emoji is treated as a decorative element with no
semantic meaning and is hidden from assistive technology.

```jsx {% live=true %}
<Heading>
  Ornamental <Emoji symbol="ðŸ™ˆ" /> usage
</Heading>
```

## Accessibility

The Emoji component wraps the provided symbol in a `span` with a `role="img"`
attribute.

If a label is provided, then it is passed as an `aria-label` to the `span`.

```jsx
<Emoji symbol="ðŸš€" label="rocket ship" />
// yields
<span aria-label="rocket ship" role="img">ðŸš€</span>
```

If not, then `aria-hidden` is set to `true`.

```jsx
<Emoji symbol="ðŸ¤«" />
// yields
<span aria-hidden="true" role="img">ðŸ¤«</span>
```
