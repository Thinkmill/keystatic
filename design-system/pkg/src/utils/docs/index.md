## Emoji

Emojis can add playfulness to your interface, but require formatting to ensure
that they are accessible for all users.

The `Emoji` component wraps the provided symbol, defining it as an image. The
provided label will be announced by a screen reader. If no label is provided,
the emoji is assumed to be a decorative element with no semantic meaning and is
hidden from assistive technology.

```jsx {% live=true %}
<Flex gap="large">
  <Emoji symbol="ðŸŽ‰" label="Hooray!" />
  <Emoji symbol="ðŸŽ‰" />
</Flex>
```
