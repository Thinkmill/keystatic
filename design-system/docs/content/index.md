## Voo-what?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voussoir):

> A voussoir (/vuˈswɑːr/) is a wedge-shaped element, typically a stone, which is
> used in building an arch or vault. Although each unit in an arch or vault is a
> voussoir, two units are of distinct functional importance: the keystone and
> the springer. The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of
> an arch. The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side, located where the
> curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or
> pier.

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear
standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

While it may sound odd at first, we believe "voussoir" is a great descriptor for
the system designed to service [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/); a tool that
enables consumers to build their own applications.
